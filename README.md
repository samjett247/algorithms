# Algorithms
Algorithm practice in various languages

### Python
For python implementations of Cracking the Coding interview algorithms, run the following commands from terminal, with your desired env activated.
- `pip install requirements.txt`
- `jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension`
Then run `jupyter lab` and open the CTCI.ipynb file.
* If you would like to add the current env as a kernel in Jupyter, use the following command, replacing myenv with the name of your desired env: `python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name "myenv"`

### Haskell
Not much here currently, but all of my practice in Haskell is based on the book **Learn you a Haskell for Great Good** available [here](http://learnyouahaskell.com/chapters), and all source/practice is in the `/haskell/` folder.
